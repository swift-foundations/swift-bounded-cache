# Cache Primitives

![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active--development-blue.svg)
[![CI](https://github.com/swift-primitives/swift-cache-primitives/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swift-primitives/swift-cache-primitives/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`Cache<Key, Value>` — a thread-safe, compute-if-absent async cache. `value(for:compute:)` returns a cached value, or runs the async compute closure on a miss and stores the result. Concurrent callers requesting the same missing key **coalesce onto a single in-flight computation** rather than each running the work — so a burst of cache misses for one key does the expensive work once, not N times.

---

## Key Features

- **Compute-if-absent** — `value(for:compute:)` runs the async closure only on a miss; hits return immediately.
- **Request coalescing** — concurrent misses for the same key await one shared computation (no thundering herd, no duplicate work).
- **Typed throws** — fallible computation surfaces as `Cache.Error`; a failed computation does not poison later attempts.
- **`Sendable`** — safe to share across tasks; `Key: Hashable & Sendable`, `Value: Sendable`.

## Quick Start

```swift
import Cache_Primitives

let cache = Cache<String, Int>()

// Compute-if-absent: the closure runs once per key. Concurrent callers for the
// same key await the single in-flight computation rather than duplicating it.
let timeout = try await cache.value(for: "config.timeout") {
    try await fetchTimeout()        // your async work — only runs on a miss
}
```

## Installation

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-primitives/swift-cache-primitives.git", branch: "main")
]
```

```swift
.target(
    name: "App",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Cache Primitives", package: "swift-cache-primitives")
    ]
)
```

The package is pre-1.0 — depend on `branch: "main"` until `0.1.0` is tagged. Requires Swift 6.3 and macOS 26 / iOS 26 / tvOS 26 / watchOS 26 / visionOS 26 (or the corresponding Linux / Windows toolchain).
